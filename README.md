# TripleBronze
Triples the amount of bronze you get with each craft so that crafting bronze is consistent (1 tin ingot + 2 copper ingots = 3 bronze ingots)
Place `.dll` file in to Valheim/BepinEx/plugins/ folder.
Requires BepinEx.

There is a configuration file to change the multiplier of bronze. After the first run, this file will be automatically created at "BepinEx/config/LolmanXDXD.TripleBronze.cfg"

## Changelog 1.0
