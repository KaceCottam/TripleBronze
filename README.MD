# TripleBronze

Triples the amount of bronze you get with each craft so that crafting bronze is consistent (1 tin ingot + 2 copper ingots = 3 bronze ingots)

There is a configuration file to change the multiplier of bronze. After the first run, this file will be automatically created at "BepinEx/config/com.KaceCottam.cfg"

Set up with [Jotunn Mod Stub](https://github.com/Valheim-Modding/JotunnModStub)!
